## 1. Project Overview

The Alumni Association Platform is a comprehensive system designed for the Government Engineering College to foster connections between graduates and their alma mater. The platform will be available as both web and mobile applications, offering a range of features to enhance alumni engagement, facilitate networking, and support the institution's growth.

### Objectives:
- Enhance alumni engagement
- Facilitate networking and career advancement
- Streamline donation processes
- Showcase alumni achievements
- Organize events and reunions
- Gather feedback for continuous improvement

## 2. System Architecture

The system will follow a client-server architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: 
  - Web Application (React.js)
  - Mobile Application (React Native)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Cloud Services**: AWS for hosting and storage

## 3. Frontend Development

### Web Application (React.js)
1. Set up a new React project using Create React App
2. Implement responsive design using Material-UI or Bootstrap
3. Create reusable components for common elements (e.g., headers, footers, forms)
4. Implement routing using React Router
5. Use Redux for state management

### Mobile Application (React Native)
1. Initialize a new React Native project
2. Implement navigation using React Navigation
3. Design responsive layouts for various screen sizes
4. Utilize native components for platform-specific features
5. Implement push notifications for events and updates

## 4. Backend Development

1. Set up a Node.js project with Express.js
2. Implement RESTful API endpoints for all features
3. Use Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling
4. Implement authentication middleware using Passport.js
5. Set up email service for notifications (e.g., Nodemailer)

## 5. Database Design

Design MongoDB collections for:
- Users (Alumni)
- Events
- Job Postings
- Donations
- Success Stories
- Feedback and Surveys

Implement proper indexing and data validation.
